GridTone is a 99% HTML5/javscript generative sound instrument.<br> 
A total of 24 notes from middle C plus one full octave make up the [current] sound library.

<h3>Cellular Automatation</h3>
<p>The instrument follows these basic set of rules: 
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>For each grid block a note is assigned.</li>
		<li>Blocks travel in the direction shown with the arrow and when they hit a wall, they play the note on the grid block.</li>
		<li>When a block collides with another block, they rotate and continue on.</li> 
		<li>Speed is determined by the step input in milliseconds. Higher value means longer delay between steps.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

This project aims to get the same 'instrument' to render in HTML5 and only use flash for enabled browsers. It would also be interesting to explore
how far the project can be expanded.
